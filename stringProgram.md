# Java String Programs

1) Write a Java program to find the duplicate words and their number of occurrences in a string?
    2) Write a Java program to count the number of words in a string?
    3) Write a Java program to count the total number of occurrences of a given character in a string without using any loop?
    4) Write a Java program to count the number of occurrences of each character in a string?
    5) Write a Java program to remove all white spaces from a string?
    6) Write a Java program to find duplicate characters and their count in a given string.
       For example, in a string “Better Butter”, duplicate characters and their count is t : 4, e : 3, r : 2 and B : 2.

    7) If s1 and s2 are two given strings, then write a Java program to check whether s2 is a rotated version of s1.
       For Example, If “JavaJ2eeStrutsHibernate” is a string then below are some rotated versions of this string.“StrutsHibernateJavaJ2ee”, “J2eeStrutsHibernateJava”, “HibernateJavaJ2eeStruts”.
    8) Write a Java program to reverse each word of a given string.
       For example, If “Java Concept Of The Day” is input string then output should be “avaJ tpecnoC fO ehT yaD”.
    9) How do you convert string to integer and integer to string in Java?
    10) Write a Java program to find the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.
        For example, if “javaconceptoftheday” is the input string, then the longest substring without repeating or duplicate characters is “oftheday” and its length is 8.
    11) How do you swap two string variables without using third or temp variable in Java?
    12) Write a Java program to find all permutations of a string recursively.
        For example, all permutations of string “JSP” are,
JSP, JPS, SJP, SPJ, PJS, PSJ

13) Given a string, your code must find out the first repeated as well as non-repeated character in that string.
For example, if “JavaConceptOfTheDay” is the given string, then ‘J’ is a first non-repeated character and ‘a’ is a first repeated character.
14) Write a Java program to append a given string to a text file?
15) How do you find the number of characters, words and lines in the given text file in Java?
16) Palindrome Programs In Java
17) Write a Java program to reverse a sentence word by word.
For example, If “Java Concept Of The Day” is an input string then output will be “Day The Of Concept Java”.
18) Write a Java program to remove all vowels from a string. Your program should take input string from the user and remove all vowels from this string and print it without vowels.
19) Java program to print all sub strings of a string
20) Write a Java program to find most repetitive character or maximum occurring character in the given string.
For example, if “Java Concept Of The Day” is the input string then ‘a’ is the maximum occurring character which occurred 3 times in the string.

	21) Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only. 
Example 1:Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:
Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.

	22) Given a string s, reverse only all the vowels in the string and return it.The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u', and they can appear in both lower and upper cases, more than once. 
Example 1:Input: s = "IceCreAm"
Output: "AceCreIm"
Explanation:The vowels in s are ['I', 'e', 'e', 'A']. On reversing the vowels, s becomes "AceCreIm".
Example 2:
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: "leotcede"

	23) Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.
Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

	24) Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1. 
Example 1:Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
Explanation:The character 'l' at index 0 is the first character that does not occur at any other index.
Example 2:
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
Example 3:
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1

	25) Find the difference between two strings
Exampl 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

	26) Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.
Example 1:Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
Example 2:Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
Example 3:Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"

	27) Repeated substring pattern - Given a string s, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together.
Example 1:Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
Example 2:Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
Example 3:Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times or the substring "abcabc" twice.

28) Detect capitals - Given a string word, return true if the usage of capitals in it is right.
Example 1:

Input: word = "USA"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: word = "FlaG"
Output: false

29) Given a string s, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter. 
Example 1:Input: s = "Hello"
Output: "hello"
Example 2:Input: s = "here"
Output: "here"
Example 3:Input: s = "LOVELY"
Output: "lovely"

30) Print Most common/ repeated word from the string.
